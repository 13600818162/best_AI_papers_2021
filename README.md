# 2021: A Year Full of Amazing AI papers- A Review<br/> üìå *[work in progress...]*
## A curated list of the latest breakthroughs in AI by release date with a clear video explanation, link to a more in-depth article, and¬†code.

While the world is still recovering, research hasn't slowed its frenetic pace, especially in the field of artificial intelligence. More, many important aspects were highlighted this year, like the ethical aspects, important biases, governance, transparency and much more. Artificial intelligence and our understanding of the human brain and its link to AI are constantly evolving, showing promising applications improving our life's quality in the near future. Still, we ought to be careful with which technology we choose to apply.

## Total Relighting: Learning to Relight Portraits for Background Replacement¬†[14]<a name="14"></a>
Properly relight any portrait based on the lighting of the new background you add. Have you ever wanted to change the background of a picture but have it look realistic? If you‚Äôve already tried that, you already know that it isn‚Äôt simple. You can‚Äôt just take a picture of yourself in your home and change the background for a beach. It just looks bad and not realistic. Anyone will just say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs photoshopped‚Äù in a second. For movies and professional videos, you need the perfect lighting and artists to reproduce a high-quality image, and that‚Äôs super expensive. There‚Äôs no way you can do that with your own pictures. Or can you?

## LASR: Learning Articulated Shape Reconstruction from a Monocular Video¬†[15]<a name="15"></a>
Generate 3D models of humans or animals moving from only a short video as input. This is a new method for generating 3D models of humans or animals moving from only a short video as input. Indeed, it actually understands that this is an odd shape, that it can move, but still needs to stay attached as this is still one "object" and not just many objects together...

## Enhancing Photorealism Enhancement¬†[16]<a name="16"></a>
This AI can be applied live to the video game and transform every frame to look much more natural. The researchers from Intel Labs just published this paper called Enhancing Photorealism Enhancement. And if you think that this may be "just another GAN," taking a picture of the video game as an input and changing it following the style of the natural world, let me change your mind. They worked on this model for two years to make it extremely robust. It can be applied live to the video game and transform every frame to look much more natural. Just imagine the possibilities where you can put a lot less effort into the game graphic, make it super stable and complete, then improve the style using this model...

## DefakeHop: A Light-Weight High-Performance Deepfake Detector¬†[17]<a name="17"></a>
How to Spot a Deep Fake in 2021. Breakthrough US Army technology using artificial intelligence to find deepfakes.

While they seem like they‚Äôve always been there, the very first realistic deepfake didn‚Äôt appear until 2017. It went from the first-ever resembling fake images automatically generated to today‚Äôs identical copy of someone on videos, with sound.

The reality is that we cannot see the difference between a real video or picture and a deepfake anymore. How can we tell what‚Äôs real from what isn‚Äôt? How can audio files or video files be used in court as proof if an AI can entirely generate them? Well, this new paper may provide answers to these questions. And the answer here may again be the use of artificial intelligence. The saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll believe it when I‚Äôll see it‚Äù may soon change for ‚ÄúI‚Äôll believe it when the AI tells me to believe it‚Ä¶‚Äù

## TextStyleBrush: Transfer of text aesthetics from a single example¬†[20]<a name="20"></a>
This new Facebook AI model can translate or edit text directly in the image in your own language, following the same style!

Imagine you are on vacation in another country where you do not speak the language. You want to try out a local restaurant, but their menu is in the language you don‚Äôt speak. I think this won‚Äôt be too hard to imagine as most of us already faced this situation whether you see menu items or directions and you can‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs written. Well, in 2020, you would take out your phone and google translate what you see. In 2021 you don‚Äôt even need to open google translate anymore and try to write what you see one by one to translate it. Instead, you can simply use this new model by Facebook AI to translate every text in the image in your own language‚Ä¶
